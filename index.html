                <p>
                    This diagram is taken from a series of work by Phillip Hurrell: Fracking air pollutions sources. I have chosen to critique this visualization as part of my own criticism on ‘data visualization’ produced by the architectural community. Architectural practice is visual in nature, yet the community commonly compromises visual perception for aesthetic reasons such as, choosing colours for the sake of following the general colour theme or visually structured to look ‘complete’ instead of informative. This is a problem when charts are stylized to look ‘scientific’ or ‘data driven’ when they are not, and potentially misleading readers.
                    <br><br>
                    The diagram is titled “Identifying agents and effects” and is accompanied by a body of text explaining the agents (hazardous air pollutants) and effects (health risks). It is followed by a disclaimer that ‘this diagram is indicative of these effects; however, it does not draw a direct relationship between the chemical and health issue in line with it”.
                    <br><br>
                    My first criticism of this diagram is in the choice of using a ‘broken’ line chart. The heavy use of splines implies that the author is trying to connect ‘Agent’ and ‘Effect’. However this is utterly misleading, as the ‘effect’ (health risks) are not being related to the agents at all (as seen in the curve line dividing the chemical agents from the health risks at the bottom of the chart). Furthermore, the chaotic splines seem to suggest that the author never intended their readers to tract the chemical compound from each agent and instead, using the splines as a visual composition (like modern art) and making a general statement that chemical compounds come from different agents.  
                    <br><br>
                    My second criticism is in the use of colour. Orange is used twice, once to aid with tracing the chemical compounds found from agents F and G, and a second time with a gradient in intensity, differentiating what seems to be the brain, lungs, intestine, stomach, and limbs. Why agents F and G are highlighted in orange may be a reference to earlier points, not explicitly explained in this paragraph, and will be ignored. Regarding the second point, it is unclear what the intention of the author is as they are also not referenced in the body of text. Based on personal interpretation, I believe that the author is trying to rank parts of the body function from those most affected by harmful chemical compounds (the brain) to those least affected (limbs). However, this is a case where a categorical or cyclic colour wheel would be more appropriate. This would also allow the author to match the effects identified with a part of the body (for e.g. shortness of breadth linked to lungs, headaches link to brain). 
                    <br><br>
                    My last criticisms have to do with the general formatting of the information presented. Firstly, in my opinion, it is a big mistake to array the text uniformly to the tangent of the curve. The text on the left half of the page should be rotated 180 degrees. Secondly, there should be a legend to identify what is agents A to G.
